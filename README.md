# Calibe-Web-Helper
Note: This tool is built in Rust, but I don't really know Rust - it's basically just VScode and GitHub Copilot writing this based on my prompts.

Manipulate the Calibre and Calibre-Web databases from the CLI, specifically for adding new books.  The goal is not to have to interact with a WebUI to add and share new epub and kepub files via Calibre-Web.
